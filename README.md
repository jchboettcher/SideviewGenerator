SIDEVIEW GENERATOR


HOW TO USE:

The main program resides in the file sideview_generator.pde and this is where you can display the final result. However, in order to be able to run that program, you first must obtain the points for the two words you want to convert. This is done in the get_points_from_font.pde program. Comments in both programs should provide explanations on what criteria to fill out in order to customize.


NOTES AND WARNINGS:

Double click the display screen to toggle/rotate between the two word-views. Drag the mouse around to view from any angle.

As stated above, the program will not work unless the words are first initialized in the get_points_from_font.pde program, with the desired font.

Add custom fonts to the customFonts folder, Processing only accepts .ttf and .otf files.

Do not alter the names of the folders or the names of files in the textFiles folder, as the program will no longer be able to access the points stored in these files.

The program works best with words/phrases that are similar in length. However, if some points are not showing up in the display, one way of trying to fix this is changing the font sizes of the two words accordingly to try to match up the sizes of the two words better.
